# MitochondriaCode
Do you like how energy is made in our cells? Well, this program has the goal to simulate 
aerobic respiration, latic fermentation and alcoholic fermentation!

## How it works

In eukaryotic cells, present in protozoa, animals, fungi and plants, there are two forms of energy production. One of them uses oxygen and glucose, this form is
called **aerobic respiration** and another uses only glucose, where it is called **fermentation**. The difference between the two is that aerobic respiration produces much more energy and that fermentation can have two or more by-products. In this case, the by-products are *alcohol* and *lactic acid*.

The first process in this two forms is called **glycolysis**. It happens in hyaloplasm and is composed by a series of reactions that 
extract energy from glucose by breaking it down into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvates. The progress can be visualised in this image.

At the end of the reactions we will have two pyruvic acid molecules, two NADH+ molecules and an energy balance of two ATP molecules.
These molecules will be very important for other processes. Now here there is three diferent ways for these molecules. In latic fermentation,
the pyruvates are reduced by NADH+ forming lactic acid. This fermentation is made by some fungi called *yeast*.

In alcoholic fermentation, the pyruvates are decomposed into 2 molecules of carbon dioxide, forming acetaldehyde. After that, 
NADH+ passes its electrons to acetaldehyde, regenerating NAD+ and forming ethanol. This fermentation is made by some bacteria called *Lactobacillus*.

At last, in aerobic respiration each pyruvate goes into the mitochondrial matrix—the innermost compartment of mitochondria. There, it’s converted into a two-carbon molecule bound to Coenzyme A, known as acetyl CoA. Carbon dioxide is released and  NADH+ is generated. After that, the acetyl CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule and goes through a cycle of reactions called **krebs cycle**, ultimately regenerating the four-carbon starting molecule. ATP, NADH, and FADH2 are produced, and carbon dioxide is released.

Finally, the NADH and FADH deposit their electrons in the electron transport chain. As electrons move down the chain, energy is released and used to pump protons out of the matrix, forming a gradient. Protons flow back into the matrix through an enzyme called ATP synthase, making ATP. At the end of the electron transport chain, oxygen accepts electrons and takes up protons to form water.
